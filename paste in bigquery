=================================================
Task 1: Create a dataset to store your machine learning models

=> CLICK ON YOUR QUICKLAB MENTION ON LEFT AND CLICK CREATE DATASET
=> NAME AS 'austin'

#OR USE CLOUD SHELL TO CREATE DATA SET : 
=>
bq mk austin


==================================================

Task 2: Create a forecasting BigQuery machine learning model.
=>EXPAND YOUR DATASET
#RUN QUERY IN COMPOSE NEW QUERY
===================================================
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL austin.location_model

OPTIONS

  (model_type='linear_reg', labels=['duration_minutes']) AS

SELECT

    start_station_name,

    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,

    EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM start_time) AS day_of_week,

    `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations` AS stations

ON

    trips.start_station_name = stations.name

WHERE

    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2018

    AND duration_minutes > 0

Task 3: Create the second machine learning model.

CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL austin.subscriber_model

OPTIONS

  (model_type='linear_reg', labels=['duration_minutes']) AS

SELECT

    start_station_name,

    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,

    subscriber_type,

    duration_minutes

FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips

WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2018


=============================================================
Task 4: Evaluate the two machine learning models.

#Query 2 (CCOPY AND PASTE)

-- Evaluation metrics for subscriber_model

SELECT

  SQRT(mean_squared_error) AS rmse,

  mean_absolute_error

  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL austin.subscriber_model, (

  WHERE

    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2019)

)


===========================================================
Task 5: Use the subscriber type machine learning model to predict average trip durations
The following query will list busiest stations in descending order. The busiest station for 2019 was ‚Äú21st & Speedway @PCL‚Äù.
BigQuery Console Query Editor


==============

SELECT

  start_station_name,

  COUNT(*) AS trips

FROM

  `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`

WHERE

  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2019

GROUP BY

  start_station_name

ORDER BY

  trips DESC



=====================================================
Then predict trip length.

==========================

SELECT AVG(predicted_duration_minutes) AS average_predicted_trip_length

FROM ML.predict(MODEL austin.subscriber_model, (

SELECT

    start_station_name,

    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,

    subscriber_type,

    duration_minutes

FROM

  `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`

WHERE 

  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2019

  AND subscriber_type = 'Single Trip'

  AND start_station_name = '21st & Speedway @PCL'))
